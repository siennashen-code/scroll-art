## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

## My ASCII Art

- 'Halloween.java": Prints ghosts at random locations on the terminal, row by row.
- "DNA.java": Prints out a strand of DNA, row by row. The length of each base pair is randomly generated.
